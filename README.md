# Dropdown Challenge

## About the Project

This project is a **React + TypeScript** application where users can select options from a dropdown list. The dropdown data is sourced from either:
- **Local Storage** (data source api and for persisting the user's selected options.)
- **Mock APIs** (two different mock APIs are provided for testing)

The application demonstrates the usage of:
- Using design pattern like **Strategy** for selecting between different data sources.
  Lecture for used pattern: [Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy).

- **Custom Hooks** for managing state and fetching data.
- **Responsive UI** using **CSS** to adapt the dropdown component for various screen sizes.
